OBJECTIVE:
To implement Huffman Coding algorithm for data compression and analyze its 
time complexity in different scenarios. Understanding the greedy approach 
used in building optimal prefix-free binary codes for data compression.

===============================================================================

3.1 HUFFMAN CODING

THEORY:
Huffman Coding is a lossless data compression algorithm that uses variable-length
prefix-free binary codes for different characters based on their frequencies.
Characters with higher frequency get shorter codes, while less frequent characters
get longer codes. This greedy algorithm builds an optimal binary tree (Huffman Tree)
by repeatedly merging the two nodes with lowest frequencies until only one node
(root) remains. The algorithm guarantees optimal compression for the given character
frequencies.

ALGORITHM:
1. Calculate frequency of each character in the input text
2. Create leaf nodes for each character with their frequencies
3. Build a min-heap (priority queue) with all leaf nodes
4. While there are more than one node in the queue:
   a. Extract two nodes with minimum frequency
   b. Create a new internal node with frequency = sum of two nodes
   c. Make the two extracted nodes as children of new node
   d. Insert the new node back into the priority queue
5. The remaining node is the root of Huffman Tree
6. Generate binary codes by traversing from root to leaves
7. Encode the text using generated codes

WORKING MECHANISM:
- Uses greedy approach to build optimal tree
- Employs min-heap for efficient minimum extraction
- Generates prefix-free codes (no code is prefix of another)
- Left child represents '0' bit, right child represents '1' bit
- Leaf nodes contain characters, internal nodes contain frequencies

TIME COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS:

BEST CASE: O(n + k log k)
- Occurs when all characters have equal frequency
- Building frequency map: O(n) where n = text length
- Building heap: O(k) where k = unique characters
- Tree construction: O(k log k) for k-1 merge operations
- Code generation: O(k) for traversing tree
- Text encoding: O(n) for processing each character
- Overall: O(n + k log k)

AVERAGE CASE: O(n + k log k)
- Occurs with random text having varied character frequencies
- Same complexity as best case due to algorithm structure
- Performance depends on number of unique characters (k)
- For typical text: k << n, so complexity approaches O(n)

WORST CASE: O(n + k log k)
- Occurs with highly skewed frequency distribution
- One character dominates, others have very low frequency
- Still maintains same complexity bounds
- Tree becomes more unbalanced but doesn't affect asymptotic complexity

SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(k)
- Space for frequency map: O(k)
- Space for priority queue: O(k)
- Space for Huffman tree: O(k) nodes
- Space for code table: O(k)
- Overall space complexity: O(k)

===============================================================================

DETAILED COMPLEXITY BREAKDOWN:

OPERATION               | TIME COMPLEXITY | SPACE COMPLEXITY | DESCRIPTION
------------------------|-----------------|------------------|-------------
Frequency Calculation   | O(n)           | O(k)             | Scan entire text
Heap Construction      | O(k)           | O(k)             | Build min-heap
Tree Building          | O(k log k)     | O(k)             | k-1 merge operations
Code Generation        | O(k)           | O(k)             | Tree traversal
Text Encoding          | O(n)           | O(encoded_size)  | Replace each character

Where: n = input text length, k = number of unique characters

===============================================================================

COMPRESSION ANALYSIS:

BEST CASE COMPRESSION:
- All characters have equal frequency
- Tree is perfectly balanced
- Each character gets log₂(k) bits
- Compression ratio: 8 : log₂(k)

AVERAGE CASE COMPRESSION:
- Characters have varied frequencies
- More frequent characters get shorter codes
- Typical compression ratio: 2:1 to 4:1

WORST CASE COMPRESSION:
- Highly skewed frequency distribution
- Most frequent character gets 1 bit
- Least frequent characters get very long codes
- Can achieve very high compression ratios

===============================================================================

HUFFMAN TREE PROPERTIES:

1. **Binary Tree**: Each internal node has exactly two children
2. **Full Tree**: All internal nodes have two children
3. **Prefix Property**: No code word is prefix of another
4. **Optimal**: Produces minimum expected code length
5. **Unique**: Tree structure may vary but total bits remain optimal

===============================================================================

ADVANTAGES:
1. **Optimal Compression**: Guarantees minimum average code length
2. **Prefix-Free**: No ambiguity in decoding
3. **Lossless**: Original data can be perfectly reconstructed
4. **Adaptive**: Works well with any character frequency distribution
5. **Simple Implementation**: Straightforward greedy algorithm

DISADVANTAGES:
1. **Two-Pass Algorithm**: Requires complete frequency analysis first
2. **Overhead**: Must store frequency table or tree for decoding
3. **Fixed Table**: Cannot adapt during encoding process
4. **Small Files**: May not compress well due to overhead
5. **Character-Based**: Works on fixed symbols, not patterns

===============================================================================

PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS:

1. **File Compression**: ZIP, GZIP, PNG image compression
2. **Data Transmission**: Reducing bandwidth requirements
3. **Storage Systems**: Database compression, file systems
4. **Multimedia**: JPEG (modified Huffman), MP3 compression
5. **Network Protocols**: HTTP compression, data streaming
6. **Embedded Systems**: Memory-constrained environments
7. **Cryptography**: As part of compression before encryption

===============================================================================

COMPARISON WITH OTHER COMPRESSION ALGORITHMS:

ALGORITHM        | TYPE      | COMPRESSION | SPEED   | COMPLEXITY
-----------------|-----------|-------------|---------|------------
Huffman Coding   | Lossless  | Good        | Fast    | O(n + k log k)
LZW (GIF)        | Lossless  | Better      | Medium  | O(n)
Run Length       | Lossless  | Variable    | Very Fast| O(n)
Arithmetic       | Lossless  | Better      | Slow    | O(n)
Shannon-Fano     | Lossless  | Good        | Fast    | O(n + k log k)

===============================================================================

IMPLEMENTATION VARIATIONS:

1. **Canonical Huffman**: Standardized code assignment
2. **Adaptive Huffman**: Updates frequencies during encoding
3. **Modified Huffman**: Used in JPEG, handles run-length encoding
4. **Huffman with Escape**: Handles unknown characters
5. **Multi-way Huffman**: Uses more than binary tree

===============================================================================

PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION TECHNIQUES:

1. **Efficient Priority Queue**: Use binary heap implementation
2. **Code Table Caching**: Pre-compute codes for faster encoding
3. **Bit-Level Operations**: Pack bits efficiently for output
4. **Memory Management**: Reuse nodes to reduce allocation overhead
5. **Parallel Processing**: Build subtrees independently

===============================================================================

EXAMPLE ANALYSIS:

For text "ABRACADABRA" (11 characters):
- Character frequencies: A:5, B:2, R:2, C:1, D:1
- Original size: 11 × 8 = 88 bits
- Huffman codes: A:0, B:110, R:111, C:100, D:101
- Encoded size: 5×1 + 2×3 + 2×3 + 1×3 + 1×3 = 23 bits
- Compression ratio: 88:23 ≈ 3.83:1

===============================================================================

CONCLUSION:
Huffman Coding represents an optimal greedy algorithm for lossless data compression
when character frequencies are known. Its O(n + k log k) time complexity makes it
efficient for most practical applications. While it requires two passes over the
data and storage of the frequency table, its guaranteed optimality and simplicity
make it a fundamental algorithm in computer science. The algorithm's performance
is primarily determined by the number of unique characters rather than the total
text length, making it particularly effective for large texts with limited
character sets.
